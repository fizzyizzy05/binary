# Contributing to Binary
## Development
Binary is developed using GTK4, Libadwaita and Python3 using PyGObject. I recommend using [GNOME Builder from Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Builder) for development, as it automatically manages building Binary, testing it in a Flatpak and contains the runtimes and build dependencies needed.

Every time a new string is added, it's recommended to run update_translations.sh in the Builder runtime terminal. This automatically updates potfiles to accomodate for new strings, as well as for other ones moving on to different lines of code. Credit to Gregor Niehl and TheEvilSkeleton for this script.

## Translations

Binary uses ["https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/binary/](Weblate) for translations, which provides a graphical UI for translations without needing to manually edit code. If unsure, use that as it's generally easier for everyone. More experienced users who prefer to do so can also manually edit potfiles, but please be mindful of other people's work when doing this.

Remember to add your name as a translation to "translator-credits" in main.py for credit!
